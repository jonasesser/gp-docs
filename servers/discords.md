# Discord Servers

## Main Discord Server

Our main Discord server is the central hub for all players, developers, and community members. It's the primary place for general discussions, announcements, and support.

## Instance-Specific Discord Servers

Some instances of our game have their own dedicated Discord servers. These servers are tailored to the specific community and features of each instance.

Here's a list of known instance-specific Discord servers:

1. [Instance A Discord](https://discord.gg/instancealinkhere) - Focused on PvP gameplay
2. [Instance B Discord](https://discord.gg/instanceblinkhere) - Roleplay-centric community
3. [Instance C Discord](https://discord.gg/instanceclinkhere) - Modded server with custom features

Please note that these instance-specific servers are managed independently and may have their own rules and moderators.

## Benefits of Instance-Specific Discords

- Targeted discussions about instance-specific features or events
- Direct communication with instance administrators and moderators
- Community building among players of the same instance
- Specialized channels for instance-specific strategies or tips

We encourage players to join both the main Discord and their instance-specific Discord for the best community experience.
