# FAQ

## I not undestand. What is this? Is GP a free script for alt:V?

The answer is partly. The main project is a multi-server system hosted by GP. Only a small part of the code is freely available for use upon request. This is called GP-Core. See installation instructions [here](/devs/coding/installation.md).

## Can I get help from you for my own server?

Yes. We are always interested in new projects and ideas. So it is always a win-win situation. Of course, this always has its limits, but you can ask any questions in the Dev channels of the Discord.

## Are you also looking for new team members?

However, we are always looking for enthusiastic developers, admins, or supporters who we can recruit for our team. 
Since we have multiple game instances, various positions are filled multiple times. See [Organizational Structure](/Orgchart.md) for more details.
