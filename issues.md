# Issues and Notes

This section provides important information about known issues, limitations, and notes for our project. It serves as a central repository for developers and users to understand current challenges and workarounds.

## Important Note:

- Machines/devices must not be moved after being filled with items. If they are moved, all items and productions will be lost. Current solution: Wait until all productions are completed and then completely empty the machine. After that, it can be safely moved to another location.
- It could happen ON THE FIRST CONNECT. Just restart and try again. No Fear you don't need to download all again
