# Coin System

We're introducing a new reward system to encourage player feedback and bug reporting!

## How to Earn Coins

Players can earn special coins by:
- Reporting bugs and issues
- Suggesting improvements for any game features
- Providing detailed feedback about your gameplay experience
- Contributing ideas for new features

## Using Your Coins

These coins can be exchanged for:
- In-game items
- In-game currency
- Special rewards (coming soon)

The exact exchange rates and available rewards will be announced once the system is fully implemented.

## How to Submit Feedback

Currently, we are setting up multiple channels for submitting feedback:

### Discord (Coming Soon)
- A dedicated feedback channel will be available
- Special forms for bug reports and suggestions

### In-Game (Under Development)
- Direct feedback system through the game interface
- Easy-to-use bug reporting tools

> **Note:** The feedback submission system is still under construction. We'll announce when all channels are fully operational. Stay tuned for updates!

## Tracking Your Coins

Once the system is fully implemented, you'll be able to track your earned coins and available rewards through both Discord and in-game interfaces.

We appreciate your participation in helping us improve Gangsta's Paradise!
