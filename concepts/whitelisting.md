# Whitelisting

## In-Game Whitelisting Process

Gangsta's Paradise takes a unique approach to whitelisting, integrating it seamlessly into the roleplay experience. Unlike many other RP servers, there are no fixed rules or designated locations for whitelisting. Instead, it occurs naturally during your in-game interactions and experiences.

Key points to remember:

1. **Organic Process:** Whitelisting happens organically as part of your roleplay journey. You may not even realize when you're being evaluated.

2. **Instance-Specific:** Different server instances may have varying whitelisting procedures, all conducted in-character (IC).

3. **No Set Rules:** There are no predetermined rules about where or when whitelisting occurs. It's designed to be a natural part of your RP experience.

4. **Embrace the Unknown:** As a player, you won't know exactly when or how you're being assessed. This uncertainty adds to the immersive experience.

5. **Play Your Role:** The best approach is to simply focus on your roleplay. Whether you find yourself in a challenging situation or a mundane interaction, stay in character and let the story unfold.

Example Scenario:
You might find yourself in custody, facing a choice: attempt an escape or demonstrate good behavior to secure release through a psychological evaluation. Both paths are valid and could be part of the whitelisting process. The key is to stay true to your character and the situation at hand.

Remember, the goal is to create an immersive, realistic roleplay environment. By integrating whitelisting into the gameplay itself, Gangsta's Paradise offers a unique and engaging experience for all players.

## Discord Whitelisting

While the primary whitelisting process occurs in-game, there is an initial step that takes place on our Discord server. Here's how it works:

1. **Join the Discord:** First, join the official Gangsta's Paradise Discord server.

2. **Accept the Rules:** Read through the server rules carefully and accept them.

3. **Receive the "Gangster" Role:** Upon accepting the rules, you'll automatically be assigned the "Gangster" role on Discord.

4. **Access to Game Instances:** The "Gangster" role grants you access to all GP Game Instances.

5. **Additional Whitelisting Roles:** As you play and progress in the game, you may be assigned additional whitelisting roles on Discord. These roles reflect your in-game achievements and status.

Remember, this Discord whitelisting is just the beginning. The main whitelisting process continues organically within the game itself, as described in the section above.

## Character Transfer Whitelisting  

When transferring your character between server instances, your whitelisting status is generally maintained:

1. **Account-Based Roles:** Whitelisting roles associated with your account, rather than individual characters, typically remain intact and are recognized on the destination server.

2. **Possible Exceptions:** In some cases, you may undergo an additional whitelisting procedure on the new server. This is to ensure consistency across different server environments.

3. **Role Retention:** Rest assured, you won't lose your existing roles unless there are serious rule violations. In such cases, we will first have an out-of-character (OOC) discussion with you.

4. **Server-Specific Requirements:** Some servers may have unique whitelisting criteria. Be prepared to adapt to these if necessary.

5. **Continued Organic Process:** Remember that whitelisting remains an ongoing, organic process. Continue to roleplay authentically on your new server to maintain and potentially enhance your whitelisting status.
