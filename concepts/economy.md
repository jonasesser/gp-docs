# Economy

**Note: This economy system is currently a raw concept and not yet implemented. The details and features described below are subject to change during development.**

The economy in our game world is designed to be dynamic, player-driven, and reflective of real-world economic principles. While the specifics are still being refined, the following sections outline our vision for the economic system.

## Daily and Weekly Payments

Our economy system is designed to provide a balanced and realistic experience without creating undue pressure on players. Here's how it works:

### Job and Welfare Payments

- Salaries from jobs and welfare benefits are paid out on a daily or weekly basis.
- Players receive these payments even when they are not connected to the server.
- This system is intentionally designed to avoid creating a sense of obligation or pressure to constantly be online.

**Note:** Even if a player is online, they should not be forced to go to their job. It's preferable if they engage in roleplay, go to parties, or simply relax on the beach with friends. They should enjoy their job and work when they want to. They should never feel pressured. This is an important rule that should be understood by colleagues as well. Exclusion or bullying, even in-character, will not be tolerated.

### Rent and Expenses

- Rent is automatically deducted from the player's account.
- The payment system ensures that players can cover their rent without fear of going into debt.

### Absence-Related Costs

When a player is absent for an extended period, additional costs are deducted to simulate ongoing expenses:

1. Increased Food Costs: Slightly higher than normal, simulating eating out or vacation expenses.
2. Higher Utility Bills: Represents increased electricity usage, as if the character left appliances running or spent more time indoors.
3. Potential Additional Costs: May include other miscellaneous expenses related to extended absence.
4. Extended Absence Procedures:
   - For longer absences inform your job leader.
   - After 3 months, job contracts will be paused.
   - Rented rooms will be terminated.
   - Players will be notified via in-character mail.
   - Options for clearing out living spaces:
     a. Hire a clearing service to empty the apartment and store items in a container.
     b. Clear out the apartment personally before the absence.

### Performance-Based Bonuses

- Players who are actively online and working can earn additional income through performance-based bonuses.
- These bonuses are awarded for exceptional job performance, encouraging engagement and skill development.
- The bonus system may include:
  1. Productivity Bonuses: Rewards for completing tasks efficiently or exceeding quotas.
  2. Quality Bonuses: Extra pay for maintaining high standards in work output.
  3. Customer Satisfaction Bonuses: Additional compensation for positive feedback or ratings.
  4. Milestone Bonuses: Rewards for achieving specific career or project milestones.
- The bonus structure varies depending on the job type and difficulty level.
- This system provides an incentive for players to actively participate and excel in their chosen professions.
- Bonuses are separate from regular salary and welfare payments, offering an opportunity for players to significantly increase their earnings through dedicated effort.

### Benefits of This System

- Prevents excessive growth or decline of a player's bank balance during absence.
- Ensures landlords who are online still receive rent payments.
- Maintains economic balance and realism without penalizing players for time away from the game.

This approach creates a more relaxed and flexible playing experience while still maintaining the integrity of the in-game economy.


## Production and Manufacturing

- Players can engage in various production activities, from small-scale crafting to large industrial operations.
- Raw materials can be processed into finished goods, adding value and creating economic opportunities.
- Manufacturing facilities require investment in equipment and skilled labor.

## Farming and Agriculture

- Agricultural activities play a crucial role in the game's economy.
- Players can cultivate crops, raise livestock, and manage farms of various sizes.
- Seasonal changes and weather patterns affect crop yields and animal health.
- Agricultural products serve as raw materials for food production and other industries.

## Supply and Demand

- Dynamic market system where prices fluctuate based on supply and demand.
- Players' economic activities directly influence market conditions.
- Shortages and surpluses create opportunities for trade and profit.

## Resource Management

- Limited resources encourage strategic decision-making and sustainable practices.
- Players must balance resource extraction with environmental conservation.
- Renewable and non-renewable resources have different long-term economic impacts.

## Economic Policies

- Server administrators can implement various economic policies to shape the game world.
- Taxation, subsidies, and regulations can be used to influence player behavior and economic outcomes.
- Economic indicators provide feedback on the overall health of the game's economy.
