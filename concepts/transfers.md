### Cross-Instance Character Transfer and Asset Shipping

Concept Overview: The Cross-Server Character Transfer and Asset Shipping System allows players to transfer their characters and in-game possessions between server instances, simulating realistic travel between different cities. Characters can move with their personal progress intact, while assets like money, vehicles, and inventory items are transferred using in-game services that mirror real-world logistics.

Key Features:
Character Transfer:
Players can move their characters to other servers, keeping their identity, skills, and progress, simulating travel between cities.

Money Transfer:
In-game banking services allow players to send money across servers for a fee, mimicking bank wire transfers.

Vehicle Shipping:
Vehicles can be shipped between servers using a freight or transportation service, with delivery taking in-game time.

Item Shipping:
Inventory items can be sent via an in-game postal service, where items are physically transported between servers and picked up at the destination.

Benefits:
This system keeps server economies stable while enhancing the roleplay experience by offering a realistic way to transport characters and assets across the game world.

THE TRANSFER IS ONLY FOR GP-Servers. If you are an server developer and have interest to also allow a transfer from and to your server then please open a ticket on discord.

Restrictions: You cannot transfer anything which is not existing on the target server. As example if a vehicle like BMW Z4 is not existing on target it is not possible to transfer it.
