# Items

## Everything is an Item!

Realy everthing? Sure, the exception proves the rule!

"Everything is an item" is a revolutionary idea that takes the in-game items, such as an axe, chair, food, pistol, magazine, and others, and allows them to trigger events on their own. With this concept, players can interact with the items in various ways, and they can also interact with other objects such as people or cars using these items. 

This concept goes beyond the traditional approach of using items as static objects in the game world. By adding interactive and event-triggering capabilities to each item, it provides a more immersive and dynamic gameplay experience. Players can now use items in creative and unexpected ways, which adds a new layer of depth to the game.

BUT this concept also completely transforms the programming of plugins. With this concept, items now send events to the plugins, allowing for the addition of further functionalities. This represents a significant departure from the typical approach of plugins in which the plugin is the driving force that controls events within the game.

In other words, the programming mindset required to develop plugins under this concept is entirely different, opening up new and exciting opportunities for developers to explore. The potential for creating innovative plugins that interact with the items in unique and interesting ways is virtually limitless.

Overall, the "Everything is an item" concept represents a significant shift in the way developers approach programming for GTA5. It provides a more dynamic and immersive gaming experience and opens up a new world of possibilities for creativity and exploration in the game world.
