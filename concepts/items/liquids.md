Explanation for Liquids as Items:

I understand it might seem strange to consider liquids like oil, gasoline, and water as items, especially since they can't be transported or stored without a container. However, let me explain why this makes sense within our concept.

In our "Everything is an item" concept, all objects are categorized as items to maintain a uniform and manageable system. This includes liquids, which are special items because they require containers for transportation and storage. 

For instance, you can't just carry gasoline in your inventory; you need a gasoline canister or a tanker truck. Similar to how you can't transport sand without a bag or a truck, liquids need appropriate containers. This ensures a consistent and logical handling of all objects in the game.

This system simplifies the overall management of items and keeps the game's logic coherent. Each item, including liquids, follows specific rules for handling and transport, making the gameplay more intuitive and immersive.
