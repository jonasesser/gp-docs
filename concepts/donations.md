## Premium Services

We're excited to announce our new premium services, currently in early development stage. While these services are still being refined, you can already subscribe to access future premium features.

To explore our premium offerings:

2. Navigate to the "Services" section
3. Log in with your Discord account
4. Choose "Subscriptions"


### What Premium Services Offer

Our premium services focus on enhancing your overall experience without affecting in-game balance. Benefits include:

- Convenience features like chatting outside the game
- Full access to all in-game features, regardless of subscription status
- Additional control options, such as managing your character while relaxing at home

We're committed to maintaining fair gameplay. Premium subscriptions will never provide in-game advantages such as increased funds, better vehicles, or advancement opportunities.
