#Multilanguage

Most GP Servers support multilanguage. On first connect you must choose your language. Then the character creator will be opened in your selected language.
You can switch later after reconnect to another language if needed. There are also dilects which you can use.

Dialects will help you to stay in your role if you character has a special dialect.

Beside the technical possibility to change the game language, the first server instance "CrossingRoads" is a full multilanguage server. This means also the players are not language specific. You will play together with cultures around the world. It's all about realistic. So be aware that not all other players will easly understand you. You will not be forced to speak a foreign language. So as example. You native language is German. Depending on your character and you personal you don't need to understand English, or any other language. Feel free to not speak English. On the oppersite it could be a good chance to learn a foraign language better. Not one will spot on you if you say something wrongly.
