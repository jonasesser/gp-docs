# What is Gangsta's Paradise?

Gangsta's Paradise is a unique and immersive roleplaying experience that goes beyond the typical crime-focused gameplay. It's a platform where players can create and develop diverse characters in a realistic, player-driven world.

## Crossing Roads: The Multilingual GTA Roleplay Server

The first instance of Gangsta's Paradise is "Crossing Roads," a multilingual GTA Roleplay server. This server allows players from different linguistic backgrounds to interact and roleplay together, breaking down language barriers in the virtual world.

## Key Features:

1. **Realism-Focused:** Gangsta's Paradise emphasizes realistic interactions and consequences, creating a more immersive experience.

2. **Diverse Character Options:** Players are not limited to criminal roles. You can be a law-abiding citizen, a police officer, a business owner, or any other character you can imagine.

3. **Player-Driven World:** The in-game environment and economy are largely shaped by the players themselves. Your actions and decisions have a real impact on the world around you.

4. **Balance of Power:** While the name might suggest a criminal paradise, the server maintains a balance. Law enforcement and civilian roles are just as important and influential as criminal ones.

5. **Language-Specific Instances:** In addition to the multilingual Crossing Roads server, there are language-specific instances available for a more focused roleplay experience.

6. **Community Building:** Players have the opportunity to form organizations, businesses, and communities within the game, fostering a rich and dynamic social environment.

Remember, in Gangsta's Paradise, your experience is what you make of it. Whether you choose to walk the straight and narrow or live a life of crime, your choices and actions will shape your character's story and the world around you.

## Recent Developments and Future Direction

Gangsta's Paradise has undergone significant changes and conceptual revisions recently. Initially, the plan was to actively expand the gp-core in collaboration with the developer community. A point system was implemented to reward developers and potentially revoke access for inactive contributors. While this approach was initially successful, over time, contributions and bug reports decreased.

In response to these challenges, we've decided to shift our focus. The gp-core will now receive only minimal updates, with our primary attention directed towards the GP Server instances. This pivot has given rise to a hosting-centric approach, allowing us to easily launch additional game server instances.

### New Hosting Model

Our new strategy involves providing instances with an extended core code. Server teams will not have direct access to the servers or the source code. However, they are permitted to develop and provide their own plugins or mods. These can be tested with the gp-core beforehand and will then be automatically integrated into the closed server code.

This approach allows us to:

1. Maintain control over the core infrastructure
2. Ensure stability and security of the main codebase
3. Encourage innovation through custom plugins and mods
4. Streamline the process of launching new server instances

We believe this new direction will foster a more sustainable development ecosystem while still allowing for creativity and customization within the Gangsta's Paradise universe.
