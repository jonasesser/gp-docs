## GP-Core: The Foundation of Gangsta's Paradise

GP-Core (Gangsta's Paradise Core) is the foundational system that powers all instances of Gangsta's Paradise. It's a custom-built framework developed on top of the Athena framework, specifically tailored to create immersive and multilingual roleplaying experiences.

## Difference from Server Instances

While server instances like "Crossing Roads" are the player-facing environments, GP-Core is the underlying architecture that developers work with. It provides the essential functionalities, systems, and tools that enable the creation and management of these diverse roleplaying worlds.

Key differences include:
- GP-Core is the backend system, while server instances are the frontend experiences
- GP-Core contains core functionalities and APIs, while instances implement specific features and content
- GP-Core is maintained by the core development team, while instances can be customized by server administrators

## Developer-Focused

GP-Core is designed with developers in mind, providing a robust and flexible foundation for creating and extending roleplaying servers. It offers:

- Extensive documentation
- Modular architecture for easy plugin development
- API interfaces for integrating custom features
- Performance optimization tools
- Multi-language support utilities
