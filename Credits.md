# Special Thanks

A huge thank you to everyone who supports me in developing **_Gangsta's Paradise_**, my GTA RP project. This project is a true passion of mine, requiring a lot of time and dedication—a time that I mostly find at night, when everything else has quieted down.

A special thanks to my family and friends for their patience and understanding, giving me the space to bring my vision for **_Gangsta's Paradise_** to life.
